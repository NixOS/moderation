# Team rotation

The initial moderation team membership was defined through [RFC 102](https://github.com/NixOS/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0102-moderation-team.md#examples-and-interactions) and changes to the team are decided through a consensus among current moderation team members.

## Joining the moderation team

We are regularly on the lookout for new members, who we think display good social skills, while interacting on the community platforms.

The decision whether someone will be invited is then formed through a consensus among all moderation team members.

## Membership transitions

Being part of the moderation team requires active participation in the day-to-day interactions of the community.

When a member becomes inactive they will be asked to consider leaving the moderation team.

Leaving the team is not considered a permanent decision, unless the member was forced out. Previous members can more easily transition back into an active membership.
