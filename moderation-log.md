Matthew Croughan was unbanned from Discourse, GitHub, and Matrix after 2.5 months. The original ban was intended for 1 month, and was issued after several warnings about poor behavior around asking questions, respecting other community members, and being unreceptive to feedback. The ban was extended due to behavior after the ban.
