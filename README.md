# moderation home

The moderation team uses this repository as our central hub for tracking work items and documenting the best practices we have discovered.

We recognize that an open-source project is not just about the technology but also the people behind it. As such, our primary responsibility is to minimize drama, resolve interpersonal conflicts, and strongly discourage any form of abuse that could undermine our project goals.

To achieve our objectives, we are committed to maintaining transparency in our actions while respecting the privacy of those involved.
